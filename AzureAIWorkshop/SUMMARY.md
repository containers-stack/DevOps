# Summary of the New Workshop Structure

## What Changed?

### Before (Original script.js file):
- All code was in one large file (~500 lines)
- Difficult for students to navigate
- Hard to divide instruction
- Hard to manage and maintain

### After (New structure):
```
js/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.js              # Azure settings (keys and endpoints)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.js               # Common utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js                # HTML management and navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ chat.js                # Challenge 1: Chat with OpenAI
â”œâ”€â”€ rag.js                 # Challenge 2: RAG with Azure Search
â”œâ”€â”€ dalle.js               # Challenge 3: Image generation
â”œâ”€â”€ voice.js               # Challenge 4: Speech to text
â”œâ”€â”€ ocr.js                 # Challenge 5: Text extraction from images
â”œâ”€â”€ content-understanding.js # Challenge 6: Content understanding
â””â”€â”€ agent.js               # Challenge 7: AI Agent
```

## Advantages of the New Structure:

1. **Modularity**: Each challenge in separate file
2. **Clarity**: Student sees only relevant code
3. **Flexibility**: Instructor chooses which modules to activate
4. **Easy management**: Easy to add/update challenges
5. **Gradual learning**: Start simple and progress

## How to Use During Workshop:

### Step 1 - Preparation:
1. Students receive all files
2. In HTML file - all modules are commented out

### Step 2 - For each challenge:
1. Theoretical explanation
2. Activate relevant module
3. Configure Azure keys
4. Practical exercise

### Step 3 - Module activation:
Students open `index.html` and uncomment:
```html
<!-- Commented: -->
<!-- <script src="js/chat.js"></script> -->

<!-- Active: -->
<script src="js/chat.js"></script>
```

## Helper Files Created:

1. **INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Short instructions for students
2. **README-Workshop.md** - Detailed guide for instructor
3. **config.js** - Centralize all settings in one place

## Example Instruction Order:

1. **chat.js** - Simple, basic chat
2. **dalle.js** - Fun, visual results  
3. **rag.js** - Service integration
4. **voice.js** - Browser permissions
5. **ocr.js** - File handling
6. **content-understanding.js** - Advanced analysis
7. **agent.js** - Most advanced

This enables gradual and organized instruction! ðŸŽ¯
