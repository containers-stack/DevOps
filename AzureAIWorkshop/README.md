## Introduction

In this hands-on workshop, you'll explore the power of Azure AI services and learn how to build intelligent applications using pre-trained models and custom machine learning solutions. Whether you are a developer, data scientist, or AI enthusiast, this workshop will guide you through cutting-edge tools and services to enhance your applications with machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and more.

## Workshop Sections

### Chat

In the Chat section, you will learn how to integrate Azure OpenAI services to create a conversational AI assistant. You will explore how to send and receive messages, handle user inputs, and display responses from the AI model.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

The RAG section focuses on combining retrieval-based methods with generative models to provide accurate and helpful information. You will learn how to use Azure Search to retrieve relevant documents and Azure OpenAI to generate responses based on the retrieved information.

### DALL-E

In the DALL-E section, you will explore how to use Azure OpenAI's DALL-E model to generate images from textual descriptions. You will learn how to send prompts to the model and display the generated images in your application.

### Voice

The Voice section covers the integration of Azure Cognitive Services for speech-to-text conversion. You will learn how to record audio, send it to the Azure Speech service, and display the transcribed text in your application.

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

In the OCR section, you will learn how to use Azure Document Intelligence to extract text from images. You will explore how to upload images, send them to the OCR service, and display the extracted text along with bounding boxes on the image.

### Content Understanding

The Content Understanding section focuses on using Azure AI services to analyze and understand the content of documents. You will learn how to extract key information, analyze document structure, and display the results in your application.

### Agent

In the Agent section, you will explore how to create an AI-powered agent that can assist users with various tasks. You will learn how to integrate multiple Azure AI services to build a comprehensive and intelligent agent.
