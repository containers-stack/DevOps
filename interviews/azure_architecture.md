# Azure Architecture Take-Home Task

## Objective
Design a hybrid cloud solution for a fictional company's infrastructure, integrating on-premises and Azure cloud services. The goal is to evaluate your understanding of both environments, your ability to design scalable, secure, and cost-efficient architectures, and how you present solutions visually.

## Scenario
You are tasked with designing a hybrid cloud infrastructure for **TechEdge Solutions**, a company migrating part of its on-premise environment to Azure while maintaining critical services locally. The company provides software as a service (SaaS) to its global clients and requires high availability, security, and disaster recovery.

## Requirements

- **Web Application**: The company hosts a web application that serves global clients. The application should be deployed on Azure with connections to on-premises resources and should handle scaling based on traffic.
  
- **On-Premises Integration**: Certain services, including the company's legacy database and file storage, must remain on-premises but need secure and reliable connectivity to the cloud infrastructure. Propose a solution to connect the on-premises and cloud environments seamlessly.

- **Database**: The application uses a SQL database that should have components both on-premises and in the cloud for redundancy and scalability.

- **Security**: Implement security best practices to protect both the on-premises and cloud environments, including secure connectivity between them, firewall configurations, identity management, and encryption.

- **Networking**: The company operates in multiple regions and needs a solution for secure, efficient network connections with minimal latency between the cloud and on-premises infrastructure.

- **Monitoring & Logging**: Implement a solution to monitor application performance, network traffic, and track security incidents across both environments.

- **Disaster Recovery**: Ensure that the solution is resilient to regional or on-premises failures, with proper disaster recovery mechanisms in place.

- **Cost Optimization**: Propose a solution that optimizes costs while meeting all of the above requirements.

## Deliverables

1. **Architecture Diagram**: Create a diagram that illustrates your proposed solution. You can use tools like Visio, Lucidchart, or Azure's built-in diagramming tools.

2. **Explanation**: A short explanation (1-2 pages) describing:
   - The reasoning behind the chosen services and architecture.
   - How you addressed each of the above requirements, including the hybrid on-premises/cloud aspect.
   - Security considerations, disaster recovery plan, and how you ensured seamless integration between on-premises and cloud resources.

3. **Bonus (Optional)**: Suggest a pipeline for continuous deployment of the web application.

## Submission

Please submit your diagram and explanation as a PDF within the next **3 days**. You will be asked to present and explain your architecture during the interview.
